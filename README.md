CatchCore: Catching Hierarchical Dense Subtensor
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wenchieh/catchcore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wenchieh/catchcore) [![Python 2.7](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-2.7-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-270/) ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/wenchieh/catchcore.svg)


**CatchCore** is a novel framework to detect hierarchical dense cores in multi-aspect data (i.e. tensors).
CatchCore has the following properties:

- unified metric: provides a gradient-based optimized framework as well as theoretical guarantees
- accurate: provides high accuracy in both synthetic and real data
- effectiveness: spots anomaly patterns and hierarchical dense community
- scalable: scales almost linearly with all factors of input tensor, also has linearly space complexity
