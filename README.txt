CatchCore: Catching Hierarchical Dense Subtensor

CatchCore is a novel framework to detect hierarchical dense cores in multi-aspect data (i.e. tensors).
CatchCore has following properties:

- unified metric: provides a gradient-based optimized framework as well as theoretical guarantees
- accurate: provides high accuracy in both synthetic and real data
- effectiveness: spots anomaly patterns and hierarchical dense community
- scalable: scales almost linearly with all factors of input tensor, also has linearly space complexity
